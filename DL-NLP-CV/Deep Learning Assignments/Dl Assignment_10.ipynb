First, quantization can significantly reduce the size of a machine learning model, which can make it easier to deploy on mobile devices or other resource-constrained platforms. Second, quantization can improve the latency of a machine learning model, which can make it more responsive to user input. Third, quantization can reduce the power consumption of a machine learning model, which can extend the battery life of mobile devices."
