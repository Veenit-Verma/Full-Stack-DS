    "Beam search is a technique for finding the most likely sequence of tokens in a given context. It is often used in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and text summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beam search works by keeping track of a set of possible sequences, called the beam. The beam starts out with a single sequence, the empty sequence. At each step, the beam expands by adding new sequences that are generated by adding one token to the end of the current sequences in the beam. The new sequences are generated by using the probability distribution of the next token given the current sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beam is then pruned by removing the least likely sequences. The pruning is done by keeping only the top k sequences in the beam, where k is a hyperparameter. The value of k is typically chosen to be small, such as 10 or 20.\n",

    "The beam search algorithm continues in this way until the end of the sequence is reached. The sequence with the highest probability in the beam at the end of the sequence is the most likely sequence.\n",

    "Attention mechanism is a way to focus on specific parts of an input sequence. This is useful in tasks where the input sequence is long or complex, and the model needs to be able to focus on the most relevant parts. There are a number of different ways to implement an attention mechanism. One popular approach is to use a neural network to learn the attention weights. The neural network takes as input the entire input sequence and the output sequence, and it outputs a set of attention weights. The attention weights are then used to weight the input sequence, and the weighted sequence is then used to generate the output sequence. Attention mechanisms are a powerful tool that can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models on a variety of tasks. If you are looking for a way to improve the performance of your machine learning models, then attention mechanisms are a good technique to consider."
